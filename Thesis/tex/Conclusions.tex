\section{Research Questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the performance and stability like for the system and how can be be improved?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Where are the bottlenecks for the system?
		\item What is the average time an agent needs to wait for a reply from another agent?
		\item On average, how long does it take to read data from the database?
		\item On average, how long does it take to write data to the database?
	\end{itemize}
\item Is the scheduling algorithm defined in paper: 'Multiagent-based agile manufacturing\cite{PAPER70}' suitable for implementation in REXOS?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Which parts of the algorithm is suitable for REXOS and what parts are not?
	\item If some parts can't be added directly, what is a better way to implement these?
	\item what is the performance of this scheduling and how can this be tested?
	\end{itemize}
\item Is REXOS best suited for a hierarchical or a heterarchical setup?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item How can this be tested?
	\item Could there be a better result when switching between these setups?
	\item If so, when will it be feasible to switch between the setups?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
