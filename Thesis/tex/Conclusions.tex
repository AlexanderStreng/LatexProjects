\section{Research Questions}

\subsection{What is the performance and stability of the system and how can this be improved?}
Answer: %How to answer what is the performance?? Stability was horrendous due to inconsistency
\\Reasoning:

\subsubsection*{Where are the bottlenecks for the system?}
Answer: %Not sure we have a conclusion for this as we only tested MAS
\\Reasoning:

\subsubsection*{What is the average time an agent needs to wait for a reply from another agent?}
Answer: %find in results
\\Reasoning:

\subsection{Is the scheduling algorithm defined in paper: 'Multiagent-based agile manufacturing\cite{PAPER70}' suitable for implementation in REXOS?}
Answer: %Partially?
\\Reasoning:

\subsubsection*{Which parts of the algorithm are suitable for REXOS?}
Answer: %Alex or Roy
\\Reasoning:

\subsubsection*{If some parts can't be implemented directly, what is a better way to implement these?}
Answer: %Alex or Roy
\\Reasoning:

\subsubsection*{What is the performance of this scheduling algorithm?}
Answer: %Alex or Roy
\\Reasoning:

\subsection{Is REXOS best suited for a hierarchical or a heterarchical setup?}
Answer: %If choosing one or the other, then the best would have to be ....
\\Reasoning: %because advantages & disadvantages comparison between the two

\subsubsection*{Is it possible to combine these setups?}
Answer: %Yes
\\Reasoning: %this part can be done so, and that part so

\subsubsection*{If so, does this give a better result?}
Answer: %It can
\\Reasoning: %because advantage A solves disadvantage B

\subsubsection*{If so, which combination works best?}
Answer: %What did we decide?
\\Reasoning: %Well, because...
