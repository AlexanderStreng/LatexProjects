\section{Research Questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the performance and stability of the system and how can this be improved?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Where are the bottlenecks for the system?
		\item What is the average time an agent needs to wait for a reply from another agent?
		\item On average, how long does it take to read data from the database?
		\item On average, how long does it take to write data to the database?
	\end{itemize}
\item Is the scheduling algorithm defined in paper: 'Multiagent-based agile manufacturing\cite{PAPER70}' suitable for implementation in REXOS?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Which parts of the algorithm are suitable for REXOS?
	\item If some parts can't be implemented directly, what is a better way to implement these?
	\item What is the performance of this scheduling algorithm?
	\end{itemize}
\item Is REXOS best suited for a hierarchical or a heterarchical setup?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Is it possible to combine these setups?
	\item If so, does this give a better result?
	\item If so, which combination works best?
	\end{itemize}
