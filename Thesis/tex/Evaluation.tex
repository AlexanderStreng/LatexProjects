%Initial situation%
In hindsight the project went pretty well. When the project initially started, we where told we had to work with 3 interns. At first we thought that this would have a drastic effect on our performance, but this wasnt to bad. It led to a combined effort from both sides to improve the system as much as possible. During the numerous brainstorm sessions we had in this semester, the input from the interns was invaluable.

%state of the project when we started
When we started working on the project things where a mess. There was almost no documentation at all and we had to pretty much figure out everything for ourselves. After a couple of weeks slowly but steadily some structure was formed. Server passwords where found and recovered. Once we got the system up and running, the real work could begin. 

%Precision Fair%
In the weeks leading up to the precision fair, alot of work had to be done. Since the project was left in a pretty drastic state, we had quite some stress (and some terrible work hours as well!) getting it all toghether. Thanks to a lot of team effort and hard work we were able to give a proper demo, and visit the fair ourselfs. During the fair the whole team(researchers \& interns) booked a stay in a hotel in Eindhoven.

%FAIM%
Writing the FAIM paper put us back into 'overdrive' as with the precision fair. We had to write a simulator and gather data on a very short notice, even missing our own deadline for our thesis. Since we did learn a lot from co-writing the paper it was not to bad. 

%remainder of the project - write something nice about the research semester%
After writing the paper for FAIM our final deadlines appeared on the horizon(-> lolercake). At the time of writing we are pretty sleep-deprived but satisfied.
