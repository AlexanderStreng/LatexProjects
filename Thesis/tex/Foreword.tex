\section{Foreword}
This document describes the results of both an improvement of the current REXOS architecture as well as research in ways to improve it even more.

After evaluating the research semester we have to say that being able to participate on a project of this scale has been quite the experience. Whilst we did not do some things we expected that we'd be doing, we ended up doing quite some things that we had not expected. 

We would like to start off by thanking the interns: T. Bakker, A. Hustinx and G. Hakopian. They helped us through a variety of problems. We ended up working as a single team instead of two seperate teams.

We would also like to show our appriciation to the project's supervisor, Daniel Telgen. despite not having a lot of time, Daniel was always available for feedback, comments or just ordinary chatter. Also for giving us more time than initially given by the University Utrecht.
