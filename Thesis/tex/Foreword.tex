\section{Foreword}
This document describes the results of both a improvement of the current REXOS architecture as well as research in way to improve it even more.

Evaluating the research semester we have to say that beeing able to participate on a project of this scale has been quite the experience. Whilst we did not do some things we expected that we'd be doing, we did quite some things that we did not expected. 

We would like to start off by thanking the interns that helped us throughout a variety of problems. We ended up working as a real time instead of researchers vs the interns.

We would also like to show our appriciation to the project's supervisor, Daniel Telgen. Whilst we put alot of hours into this project, Daniel was always available for feedback, comments or just ordinary chatter.
