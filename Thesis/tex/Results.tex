In this chapter we will describe the results gained in this project. We will tell something about gaining the the stable architecture, and the build up to the precision fair. We will also try to explain the results gained from research and simulation of the heterarchical vs. hierarchical system.

\section{REXOS Architecture}
Throughout the whole project the main subject was constantly improving and modifying the current REXOS architecture. During the first part of the research a deadline was set to write and research feasable demos for the precision fair. After the precision fair, a simulation had to be written in order to research the advantages of reserving equiplets for batches (hierarchical control).
