\section{Summary}
This thesis describes research done for the improvement of the REXOS project. 

Most current day manufacturing systems consist of large productions lines capable of producing a single unchanging product at high speeds. This kind of manufacturing is called static manufacturing. In order to overcome the downsides of static manufacturing, research is being done to develop new paradigms. One of these new paradigms is what Y. Koren describes as \emph{"Reconfigurable machines (RMS) are machines whose structures can be changed to provide alternative functionality or/and upgradeable capacity on demand"}\cite{Koren}

The University of Applied Sciences Utrecht formulated their own solution regarding manufacturing. The REXOS project is this solution. REXOS uses the concept of grid manufacturing, which is based on RMS. 

When this iteration of the project started, the architecture of the project was unstable and it could not run without generating errors. One of the issues discovered while improving the architecture is that the communication between agents was confusing and inconsistent. The ontologies used in the communication were inconsistent and were not FIPA compliant.

One of the elements not implemented into the first iteration of the MAS was scheduling. A scheduling algorithm was researched and discussed as a possible solution. There were two major issues with the algorithm however, and this resulted in a new implementation being researched using this algorithm as its base.

During the project, a simulation of the platform was created in order to gather data for the FAIM paper found in appendix~\ref{app:faim}. This simulation enabled the running of test scenarios or cases. The new implementation for the scheduling algorithm was implemented into the simulation and was tested during the running of the test cases. The test cases included scenarios with and without batch reservations, exclusive and non exclusive reservation.

The project end results include a more stable architecture with a partially implemented scheduling algorithm. Whilst the REXOS architecture is very likely to change in the future, the current situation is stable enough to build upon. A simulator was developed as well. The main reason for this simulator was testing types of control in REXOS and by doing so proof that REXOS could make good use of implementing switchable architectures is deliverd.
